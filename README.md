# 256 Shades of Gray

## Description
**256 Shades of Gray** is a simple project that visually represents all 256 possible grayscale shades in an 8-bit grayscale system. Each shade is displayed as a square with its corresponding HEX color code, allowing users to see the gradual transition from black (`#000000`) to white (`#FFFFFF`).

## Features
- 🎨 **256 Shades of Gray** – Displays all grayscale shades from 0 to 255.
- 🖱 **Click to Copy HEX Code** – Click any shade to copy its HEX value.
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – Adjusts grid layout based on screen size.
- 🌈 **Animated Gradient Text** – Eye-catching title animation.
- ✨ **Smooth Hover Effects** – Enhances UI experience.
